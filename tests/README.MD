# Project 

Here are each of the test driven scripts for this project along with the data repository of 2 examples of ab1 files {One featuring reverse only and the other being a paired example of F/R ab1 files}.

Meant to be for demonstrative use paired with the doc where I go into more detail how to use them.

Features and Data directories are used as post hoc examples for how to run and set up the post-blast run to get the BIOM file.
