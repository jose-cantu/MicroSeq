* In the future this will be treating as a landing page for labmates so they can have quick links through all the documentation. For now I'm just referencing the GUI since this is a work in progress. 

> **MicroSeq GUI preview** click and run Sanger Software tool. 

* [GUI Walkthrough](gui_usage.md)

```bash 
# launch the GUI from MicroSeq conda env 
microseq-gui 
```
